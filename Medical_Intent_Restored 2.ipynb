    "The goal of this master's project is to create a system that is part of some bigger medical system like a chatbot and it can read the input of potential patients in natural language, and then recognize the medical intent and symptoms. Since BERT is only an encoder model, we can't expect it to generate the extensive result. If there's a need to extend this chatbot we can use some open-source AI model like LLAMA-3 or Mistral AI.\n",
